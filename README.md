# Student Record

## Overview
"Student Record" is a simple Java application that demonstrates the basic principles of object-oriented programming. It is designed to manage and store information about college students, including their names, student IDs, and grades.

## Features
- Create student records with personal and academic details.
- Calculate and display letter grades based on numeric scores.
- Count the number of vowels in a student's first name (for names with exactly five letters).

## How to Run
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can compile and run the program using a Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans, or through the command line.

### Using an IDE
1. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
2. Compile and run the `StudentRecordTestHarness.java` file.

### Using Command Line
Navigate to the directory containing the source files and execute:
```shell
javac StudentRecord.java StudentRecordTestHarness.java
java StudentRecordTestHarness
```
Usage
The application will prompt you to enter details for two student records:

The first student record is pre-filled with sample data.
The second student record will be created based on the user input provided through the console.
After entering the details, the program displays the information of both students, including their calculated letter grades and the number of vowels in their first names (if the name is exactly five letters long).
